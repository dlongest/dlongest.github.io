<h1>About</h1>
<div>My name is Daniel Longest and I'm a software developer living in Charlottesville, Virginia.  I work for a not-for-profit in the financial services industry.  Most of my experience is in .NET, particularly back-end services and integration projects, but also web and desktop applications.  This blog will cover a variety of areas, but I'm heavily interested in software design.  I enjoy training other developers so most entries will focus on demonstrating or discussing areas that are weakly covered or confusing, usually drawn from questions I get asked at work.  I train .NET developers at work now and previously was responsible for company-wide SQL training for a wide-ranging audience.  That said, I feel like I learn far more from training others than they learn from me: it's definitely a two-way street.

<h2>What is A Champion?</h2>
<div>
In the most common definition, a champion is the victor of some competition.  But who are we competing against?  Sure, in some respects we compete on a daily basis (for resources, for promotions, for market share), but those are macro concerns: they say very little about the day to day decisions we all face.  The competition that matters is only against one person: yourself. 
</div>
<div>
Every day we have a choice: we can get better or we can get worse.  This may seem strange - who would choose to get worse each day?  But in the words of the great Brooks Robinson, American baseball player,</div>
<blockquote>If you're not practicing, somewhere, somebody else is, and he'll be ready to take your job.</blockquote>
<div>
Technology advances too fast to believe the skills and knowledge we have today will be sufficient tomorrow. Every day, we need to get better, even if it's just a little.  We need to learn something new, try something new, uncover something new.  We need to live in the space between the skills we have and their limits: it is only here that we can make progress.  This is an uncomfortable place to be, but we must get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

<blockquote>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>
Outside of work, I have a wife, one son, and another son on the way plus two dogs.  I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Old Dominion University as well as a Masters of Science in Information Technology from Virginia Tech.  And because I can't get enough, I'm working on a Masters of Engineering in Modeling and Simulation from Old Dominion University.  In my spare time, I enjoy officiating high school football and wrestling, running, and shooting sporting clays.
